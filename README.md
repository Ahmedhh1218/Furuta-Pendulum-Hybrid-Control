# Furuta Pendulum Hybrid Control

This repository hosts the code and documentation for the Furuta Pendulum Hybrid Control project. We employ advanced control techniques in MATLAB/Simulink to achieve precise stabilization and control of the Furuta Pendulum while maintaining an upright position (theta1 = 0). 

## Project Overview

The Furuta Pendulum poses a complex control challenge, requiring sophisticated control strategies and real-time simulation. In this project, we focus on the following technical aspects:

- **Pole Placement Control**: We implement pole placement techniques to design a control system that ensures the Furuta Pendulum remains upright. By strategically placing the system poles, we achieve precise control over its dynamics.

- **Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) Simulation**: To simulate real-world conditions and disturbances, we employ HIL testing. This approach enables us to validate our control algorithms in a practical context, preparing the system for real-world implementation.

- **MATLAB GUI Integration**: We develop an interactive MATLAB GUI linked to Simulink for real-time system monitoring and control. This GUI offers functionalities such as displaying system parameters, time responses, control efforts, sensitivity functions, and the ability to introduce external disturbances. Additionally, it allows for dynamic adjustments of regulation and tracking parameters.

- **Project Milestones**: We maintain a record of key project milestones, documenting our progress, challenges faced, and solutions implemented throughout the development process.
